      <a>His Story</a>
      <a>I grew up in a rural town called Teutopolis, IL, where I was born and raised with my family. I grew up with three brothers, where I am the second oldest. I have always been quiet, but I love to talk about my interests and passions. I enjoy music and spending time outdoors. I went to Lake Land College and graduated from University of Illinois and have a career in computer science making flight simulators.</a>

      <a>Their Story</a>
      <a>We met on Tinder! It was love at first swipe! We had our first date with some friends at a mall in Champaign. We were both super nervous, but we hit it off right away! He loved her creativity and she loved his outgoing will. We kept talking and fell in love. On New Year's Eve, we decided to go to the same party. We fell so hard for each other that at 12:00 a.m. on the dot, we decided to make our relationship official and the rest is history!</a>
