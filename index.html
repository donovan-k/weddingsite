      <a>His Story</a>
      <a>We knew each other from community college, but had our first date with some friends at a mall in Champaign. We were both super nervous, but we stayed close to each other and really hit it off. He loved her creativity and she loved his outgoing will. We kept talking and fell in love. On New Year's Eve, we decided to go to the same party. We stayed close and took care of each other and fell so hard for each other and at 12:00 a.m. on the dot, we decided to make our relationship official and the rest is history!</a>
